This repository contains Local Goverment Denmark FHIR profiles and documentation. Local Goverment Denmark is a non-profit organisation financed by the Danish municipalities. The Danish municipalities deliver health and social care in homes, nursing homes and local facilities. Professional documentation is done according to the documentation-methods and terminologies described in FSIII (http://fs3.nu/), FFB (https://www.kl.dk/kommunale-opgaver/socialomraadet/faelles-faglige-begreber/) and VUM (https://socialstyrelsen.dk/tvaergaende-omrader/sagsbehandling/voksenudredningsmetoden). The terminology server related to this project is http://kl.healthterm.com/.

Changes to the IG are automatically built and viewed at http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7dk/LocalGovermentDenmark as an HL7 Implementation Guide. Profiles can also be viewed on Simplifier at https://simplifier.net/klcommondanishmunicipalitiesprofiles
